# Amplifiers and Feedback
## Summary
Third lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. All data analysis was done on excel so no .py files are included. Note that no lab report was written for this experiment.

The aim of this experiment was to apply circuit theory to building circuits using amplifiers and feedback mechanisms. This included circuits such as: Summer, Integrator, Schmitt Trigger, Wein Bridge Oscillator and the 2-Bit ADC.

## Technical Highlights
* Circuit building
* Excel data visualisation
* Complex number mathematics

## Files
* Amplifiers and Feedback Lab Script.pdf contains a brief outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Amplifiers and Feedback Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
