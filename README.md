Third lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. All data analysis was done on excel so no .py files are included. Note that no lab report was written for this experiment.

* Amplifiers and Feedback Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Amplifiers and Feedback Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
